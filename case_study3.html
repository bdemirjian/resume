					<h2>CONTEXT</h2>
					<!-- purpose of case study: set the stage for the problem -->
					<p>
						<strong>NEW CIO AND DRIVE TO MODERNIZE</strong>
							| New CIO arrived with plans to modernize management methods as well as technology. 
						<br> </br>
						<strong style="color:Red;">Business & Technology Transformation | 15 Teams | 4 Offices | One Year</strong>
						<br> </br>
						<strong>CURRENT BUSINESS PROCESSES</strong>
							| Strong Sales and Marketing business units with a weak product unit yielded no long-term vision or goals.
							Additionally, work management was not based on a prioritization schema.
						<br> </br>
						<strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong>
							| Our back-end was based on Perl, an almost extinct language.
							We found it hard to locate effective developers and are in the process of strangling it off into a modern Java based architecture.
					</p>

					<h2>FINDINGS</h2>
					<!-- your skills AKA "buzzwords" -->
					<p>
						<strong>OPPORTUNITIES</strong>
							| Business Intelligence partners revealed a number of opportunities lurking in our traffic data.
						<br />
						R&D Teams built accelerators and easy integrations which unlocked cross-pillar-sales.
						<br> </br>
						<strong>PRODUCT & MARKETING MISALIGNMENT</strong>
						| Product and marketing were at odds. The new vision was hard to manifest and strong facilitation was required.

					<h2>END-STATE</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
					<p>
						<strong>TRAFFIC! ADDONS PAGE</strong>
						| Fitting the context of our use-case, the churn, and where it was in our flow, the tests with a dedicated Addon page kept winning. 
						<br />
						This accelerated the growth of our high-profit products, as we were able to optimize against this low-cost, high churn resource.
						<br> </br>
						<strong>EXPANDED OPPORTUNITY SPACE</strong>
						| The cross-pillar sales experiment opened a whole vista to be optimized. 
						Our Google Analytics SMEs helped us start to categorize these opportunities and potential tradeoffs.
					</p>

					<h2>EMERGENT WIN CONDITIONS</h2>
					<!-- your work experience -->
					<p>
						<strong>EMPOWERED TEAMS</strong>
						| CIO chose to invest in more force-multipliers to assist in forming empowered teams.
						Teams now include Business, Technology, Data Intelligence partners.
						Standups include traffic dashboards and test strategy discussions.
						The feed-back loops were so fast that in-production changes were occurring the same day in many cases.
