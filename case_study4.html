					<h2>CONTEXT</h2>
					<!-- purpose of case study: set the stage for the problem -->
					
                    <strong>POST MERGER OF WEB.COM AND ENDURANCE GROUP</strong>
					 | A merger of the 2nd and 3rd largest hosting companies in the world.
					 The front of site teams for our <strong style="color:Red;">Growth Brands</strong> were languishing between non-intersecting Marketing and Product goals.
					 Which the CMO believes are resulting in a drop-off in conversion rates.
					 Coupled with staff reductions we witnessed a significant drop in morale.
                    <br> </br>
					<strong style="color:Red;">FOS Agile Transition | 10 Teams | 3 Offices | One Year</strong>
					<br> </br>
					<strong>CURRENT BUSINESS PROCESSES</strong>
					 | The weakly mergered Product and Marketing business units were suffering from a lack of clear direction, and were given tactical goals.
					 The end of the COVID bump for the hosting sector was starting to receed, and in its wake PANIC!.

					<h2>END-STATE</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
						<strong>STAKE-HOLDER 180</strong>
						| The stake-holder council is a big hit, instead of working around each other they are working with each other to prioritize work. 
						<br />
						Constraint after contraint fell, soon we were legion chasing each new constraint, tapping each others strengths.
						<br> </br>
						<strong>EMPOWERED TEAMS MAKE FEED-BACK LOOPS AS NEEDED</strong>
						| As the teams became more and more familiar with each other problems were resolved in minutes instead of hours or days. 
						As our marketing team requires the ability to change priorities within our release window we developed just-in-time refinement.

					<h2>EMERGENT WIN CONDITIONS</h2>
					<!-- your work experience -->
						<strong>PREDICTIONS & ART</strong>
						| Our business intelligence predictions allowed us to course-correct away from serious user churn.
						Standing back and evaluating our growth brands we notice a significant delta in winning tests vs visual appeal.
						We are going to investigate this discovery and see how to manage it.
