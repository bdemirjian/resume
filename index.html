					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
					<p>I believe in a non-confrontational, non-coercive approach to change in which people are invited to be and act in a new way. I am a passionate advocate of continual learning and improvement seeking to understand the nature of software development from as many perspectives as possible. I seek to pull ideas from a broad number of sources and pragmatically select and blend those that work in a given context commonly pulling from topics such as systems theory, cognitive psychology, professional coaching, organizational dynamics, and even world history to find unique ideas.</p>

					<h3><b>ENTERPRISE AGILE COACH</b></h3>
                    <p>
                            Newfold Digital | 2019 - Present | Burlington, MA USA
                    </p>
                    <p>
						I joined Newfold Digital, Endurance Internatioal Group at the time, to help lead the Domain.com business unit through an
						agile transformation into a technical and product juggernaut. Approximately one-year in pursuit of this effort, after making serious head-way 
						and strangulating our Perl-based system into a robust modern Java code-base, we merged with web.com.
						<br></br>
						I was swiftly moved to help unify the Storefront Business units for these very different pillars. I partnered with a Product-Marketing Vice President from web.com, 
						and we co-led the newly merged vertical. We organized our test logic and scheduling. 
						We worked Google Analytics deep into our flows and BI folks into our teams. 
						We succeeded in getting our teams to review tableau dashboards and to debate or improve the logic of tests in standup. 
						We more than tripled our story output under current conditions.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                            <li><b>Leadership Based Highlights </b>| Presented key strategic workshops at user conference. Persuaded
								leadership to shift to team incentives from individual incentives. Brought transparency to decision
								making through workshops and delegation boards. Drove alignment around Scrum’s central
								conflict using facilitation, workshops, and working agreements.</li>
							<li><b>Team Based Highlights </b>| Top Impediment to Top Story in 8 months tripled throughput. Onboarded
								23 teams into agility in India and US. Implemented Kanban with six full-stack support
								teams that reduced cycle time by 80%. Led high profile and high risk DevOps experimental team
								that reduced deployment from one month with 30+ people to one-day : one-person in 6 months.</li>
							<li>Cool accomplishment</li>
					</ul>
                    <h3><b>AGILE COACH</b></h3>
                    <p>
                            HealthEdge | 2016 - 2019 | Burlington, MA USA
                    </p>
                    <p>
						I joined HealthEdge to implement an agile culture and best technical practices after conducting initial
						waves of training and intense coaching. HealthEdge grew from 150 people with two domestic
						locations to 500+ people with five global locations during my tenure. Key to this growth ROI was
						changing culture to celebrate collaboration that resulted in automation & hardening of several key
						components like all testing, deployment to product and development, monitoring & self-healing.
