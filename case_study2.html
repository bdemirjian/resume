					<h2>CONTEXT</h2>
					<!-- purpose of case study: set the stage for the problem -->
					<p>
						<strong>NEW CEO AND REORGANIZATION</strong>
							| New CEO arrived with plans to modernize management methods and with a clear, COLLABORATIVE vision.
						<br> </br>
						<strong  class="reds">Agile Transformation | 25 Teams | 3 Offices | One Year</strong>
						<br> </br>
						<strong>CURRENT MANAGEMENT PROCESSES</strong> | 
						Inconsistent at best, Business Unit interfaces were challenging and avoided.
						Pain-derived big-bang releases happened quarterly and were overnight affairs.
						<br> </br>
						<strong>SLOTHLIKE</strong> | 
						This was the most colorful word used by our largest customer to describe our pace of general software development.
						Some of our products suffered from a myriad of legacy-based issues.
					</p>
				</section>

					<h2>FINDINGS</h2>
					<!-- your skills AKA "buzzwords" -->
					<p>
						<strong>DISTRIBUTION AND TIMING</strong><br />
						HQ in New England, USA | 15 Teams<br />
						Satellite Office in MidWest, USA | 5 Teams<br />
						New Office Opened in Mumbai, India | 5 Teams<br />
						Week-long training, including specialized PO portion, was conducted in two waves in each location.
						<br> </br>
						<strong>PRODUCT & MARKETING MISALIGNMENT</strong>
						| Product and marketing were at odds. The new vision was hard to manifest and strong facilitation was required.

					<h2>END-STATE</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
					<p>
						<strong>3x+ KUMBAYA?</strong>
						| Absolutely! Within six months of training, HQ-based teams had 2X their throughput with much heavier testing requirements. 
						Within a year the HQ-based teams were at 3.5x their previous throughput.<br />
						Customer engagement went from two regular attendees of our bi-weekly demonstrations to over 250, spanning more than 50 companies.
						This led to many of our customers investing in us, accelerating our growth, and reducing our time to market.
						<br> </br>
						<strong>STABILIZED THE TERMINAL PATIENT</strong>
						| One of our products was in really bad shape. While being a market leader, the technology behind it was embarrassingly bad.
						These business units rebounded within six months and they were reporting better customer outcomes.
						Further, they were on a path to modern architecture within 18 months.
					</p>

					<h2>EMERGENT WIN CONDITIONS</h2>
					<!-- your work experience -->
					<p>
						<strong>HEALTHEDGE USER CONFERENCE | WORKSHOPS</strong>
						| To manifest the power of collaboration I implemented workshops where success was dependent on interaction, while I provided active facilitation.
						They proved so successful that the workshop is now used on all products and at every user conference since, and I handed it off to marketing.
						<br> </br>
						<strong>PROFESSIONAL SERVICES COLLABORATIVE</strong>
						| At the user conference PS announced a new service based upon the Agile transformation | <strong style="color:Red;">AGILE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES</strong>.
						Our top three customers were already participating at the highest level within a month.
